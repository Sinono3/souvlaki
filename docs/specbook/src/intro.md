# Introduction

This resource gathers specifications of OS media controls of
various different platforms, with the goal of facilitating
development using these interfaces, for cross-platforms applications and
libraries.

It was specifically created to facilitate development of the
[souvlaki](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki) library, a cross-platform
media-control-handling library for Rust.
